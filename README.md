	The size of bubble is linked to the zoom level. A Text Size = 30 bubble at zoom 400% will be a little smaller than Text Size = 30 bubble at zoom 200%.  
 	The quality and file size of saved pdf will depend on the zoom level at which it is saved. Pdf saved at zoom = 200% is smaller than Pdf saved at zoom = 500%.
